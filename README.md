# 🚀 AWS Hands-On Lab Repository – SAA Certification Track

This repository contains a curated collection of my **hands-on AWS projects** built as part of the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** course from **Neal Davis** that I completed in **April 2025**.

Each project folder includes:
- A step-by-step walkthrough (`README.md`)
- Screenshots of implementation (where applicable)
- AWS CLI commands, scripts, or architecture details
- Key learnings from each hands-on task

These projects reflect real-world usage of core AWS services and serve as a personal learning archive, portfolio, and reference hub.

## 📌 About This Series

All projects in this repo are part of my preparation for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)** certification.  
The goal: not just pass the exam, but **build, break, and understand** how AWS services work in practice.
